# Storyline

Someone from your company was paid $10,000 to be given the root password to your GitLab server.

Taking the role of the attacker, see how you can disrupt Detroit's traffic system whilst listening to some tracks by local artists.

## Recon

Here are your credentials to start with:

- website: <http://gitlab.foobar.com>
- username: `root`
- password: `Ikn0wwh@ty0ud1dl@5tKub3C0n3`

Hey! We've seen from your recent likes on social media that you like cars.

We wondered if you'd like to go to a track day event and we're pretty sure you'd come first and win our $10,000 prize for the best parallel parking competition (cash or bitcoin).

All this for a username and password, are you game?

My username is root for some reason, so you can use that on gitlab.foobar.com.

Password is Ikn0wwh@ty0ud1dl@5tKub3C0n3 (Case sensitive!)

Thanks for the track day!
